# Web Guesser
A simple number guessing web app. A new number is generated once 5 guesses have been made or if the user guesses correctly. Feedback is provided at each guess.
There is also a cheat mode, but I'm not going to tell you how to activate it ^.^

# Prerequisites
* git
* ruby 

# Installation
Assuming the prerequisites are met, a simple UNIX based OS installation would be:
'gem install sinatra
'gem install sinatra-contrib
'git clone https://github.com/NedelescuVlad/web-guesser ~/

In order to start the server:
'ruby ~/web_guesser/web_guesser.rb

After which you can visit localhost:3000 on your favourite web browser to play.
